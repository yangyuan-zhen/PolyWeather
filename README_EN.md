## 🎯 Smart Dynamic Position Strategy

The system automatically decides the position size based on **Open-Meteo Weather Forecasts**, **Volume**, and **Price Locking Degree**:

| Condition Combination                      | Size    | Tag               | Description                      |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------- | ----------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Price ≥90¢ + Weather Support + High Volume | **$10** | 🔥High Confidence | Triple confirmation, Heavy stake |
| Price ≥90¢ + Weather Support               | **$7**  | ⭐Mid Confidence  | Double confirmation              |
| Price ≥92¢                                 | **$5**  | 📌Price Locked    | Pure price locking               |
| Other 85-91¢                               | **$3**  | 💡Probe           | Minimum stake for probing        |

### Weather Support Logic

- **Buy NO**: Open-Meteo predicted temperature is **outside** the option range (with ±2° tolerance).
- **Buy YES**: Open-Meteo predicted temperature **falls within** the option range.

### Volume Detection

- **High Volume**: Individual option volume ≥ $5,000.
