## ✨ Core Features

### 1. 🧬 Dynamic Ensemble Blending (DEB Algorithm)

The system automatically tracks the historical performance of weather models (ECMWF, GFS, ICON, GEM, JMA) per city:

- **Error-Based Weighting**: Dynamically adjusts model weights based on their Mean Absolute Error (MAE) over the past 7 days. Lower error = higher weight.
- **Blended Forecast**: Provides a bias-corrected "DEB Blended High Temperature" recommendation.
- **Self-Learning**: Requires at least 2 days of observations before activating weight differentiation. Uses equal-weight averaging during cold start.
- **Concurrency Safe**: Built-in memory cache and file locking (fcntl) for high-concurrency group chat queries.

### 2. 🎲 Math Probability Engine (Settlement Probability)

Automatically computes the probability for each possible WU settlement integer using a Gaussian distribution fitted to the ensemble forecast:

- **Distribution Center μ**: Weighted average of DEB/multi-model median (70%) and ensemble median (30%). Auto-corrects upward when actual METAR max exceeds μ and is still rising.
- **Standard Deviation σ**: Derived from the 51-member ensemble P10/P90 (σ = (P90-P10) / 2.56).
- **Time Decay**: σ dynamically narrows based on the current time relative to the predicted peak window:
  - Before peak: σ × 1.0 (maximum uncertainty)
  - During peak window: σ × 0.7 (settling)
  - After peak: σ × 0.3 (outcome mostly determined)
- **Observed Floor**: Temperatures below the current METAR max WU value are automatically excluded (can't go back down).
- **Interval Integration**: Integrates over each WU rounding interval [N-0.5, N+0.5) to compute the probability of settling at integer N.
- **Display**: `🎲 Settlement Probability (μ=3.7): 4°C [3.5~4.5) 68% | 3°C [2.5~3.5) 32%`

### 3. 🤖 AI Deep Analysis (Groq LLaMA 3.3 70B)

Feeds wind speed, wind direction, cloud cover, solar radiation, and METAR trend data into LLaMA 70B:

- **Logical Reasoning**: 2-3 sentences analyzing airport dynamics, explicitly referencing Open-Meteo forecast and DEB blended values as benchmarks.
- **Time Awareness**: Analysis considers how much time remains until the predicted peak, judging remaining warming potential.
- **Market Call**: Explicitly states the expected peak time window and specific temperature betting range. Calls "dead market" when cooling is confirmed.
- **Confidence Score**: Quantitative 1-10 confidence rating.
- **High Availability**: Built-in auto-retry + fallback model degradation (70B → 8B) to withstand Groq API 500/503 outages.

### 4. ⏱️ Real-time Airport Observations (Zero-Cache METAR)

- **Precise Timing**: Extracts actual observation time from raw METAR text (`rawOb`), not the API's rounded `reportTime`. Accurate to the minute.
- **Live Passthrough**: Bypasses CDN caching via dynamic headers to obtain first-hand METAR reports.
- **Settlement Warning**: Automatically calculates the Wunderground settlement boundary (X.5 rounding line).
- **Anomaly Filtering**: Automatically filters out -9999 sentinel values from sources like MGM to prevent garbage data in output.

### 5. 📈 Historical Data Collection

- Includes `fetch_history.py` to retrieve up to 3 years of hourly historical weather data (temperature, humidity, radiation, pressure, 10+ dimensions), providing data foundation for future ML models (XGBoost/MOS).

## 💡 Trading Tips

1. **Watch Settlement Probability**: The probability engine is math-based and more objective than AI judgment. When one temperature has > 65% probability, the direction is relatively clear.
2. **Observe Time Decay**: Probabilities auto-lock as time progresses. After peak hours, the engine narrows σ dramatically, concentrating results around the observed max.
3. **Reference DEB Blended Value**: When models diverge, the DEB corrected value is usually more reliable than any single forecast.
4. **Observe AI Confidence**: A score below 5 indicates high uncertainty—consider staying on the sidelines.
5. **Watch Settlement Boundaries**: When the observed high is near X.5, be wary of rounding jumps during WU settlements.
6. **Distribution Center μ**: The μ value shown in the probability display represents the algorithm's expected most likely actual high temperature—compare it directly with the Polymarket odds.
