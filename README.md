## Product Status (2026-08-22)

- Forecast API live: `/api/cities/deb-forecast` returns per-city DEB prediction + 3-day multi-model daily forecasts for a 24-city default watchlist (entitlement-token auth); results are cached for 5 minutes so repeat calls answer in ~1.4s.
- DEB normal probability engine live: integer-degree probability buckets come from the DEB normal engine (`deb_normal`).
- WeatherNext2 removed: the Google WeatherNext2 GCS Zarr worker was retired; probability and forecasts rely on the DEB blend over the Open-Meteo model suite.
- Referral/invite pricing removed; points remain redeemable for payment discounts (`500 pts = 1 USDC`, monthly max `3 USDC`, quarterly max `8 USDC`). Useful user feedback can also receive manual point rewards through ops.
- Onchain checkout live: Polygon contract checkout (USDC / USDC.e) plus Ethereum mainnet USDC direct-transfer confirmation.
- Auto-reconciliation live: event listener + periodic confirm loop.
- Ops dashboard live: `/ops` for memberships, leaderboard, user feedback triage, manual point grants, and payment incident triage.
- Lightweight observability live: `/healthz`, `/api/system/status`, `/api/system/cache-status`, `/api/system/priority-warm`, `/metrics` (ops auth) + `scripts/check_ops_health.py` probes.
- Realtime terminal live: visible city charts subscribe through `/api/events?cities=...&since_revision=...`, receive `city_observation_patch.v1` SSE patches, and replay short gaps from Redis Stream in production or SQLite fallback in local/single-node mode.
- Chart refresh is observation-driven: live patches merge into the current chart without a loading overlay; only visible charts run a 60s no-patch fallback, and returning from a background browser tab triggers a foreground catch-up refresh.
- Temperature charts default to All Day, keep an optional Peak window derived from the DEB hourly path, and render all timestamps in the selected city's local time.
- The chart core has been split into focused logic/canvas/state modules; Recharts now receives explicit measured dimensions to avoid 0x0 rendering and disappearing curves.
- DEB hourly consensus (`deb_hourly_consensus.v1`) is now the preferred hourly forecast path for peak-window detection and chart overlays; DEB remains a forecast curve, never an observation source.
- Legacy Gaussian probability stays out of the default temperature chart surface; hover tooltips show `Gaussian μ` plus the full bucket distribution by temperature range.
- Settlement-source-first airport observations are visible by default, with the configured settlement station highlighted and official nearby-network stations shown as secondary context.
- Hong Kong uses CoWIN station `6087` (Po Leung Kuk Choi Kai Yau School) as the 1-minute reference-station curve, with HKO 10-minute observations kept as the official meteorological layer.
- Telegram airport pushes are bilingual by default and use settlement-endpoint temperatures for slope/current/summary copy.
- Runtime state, cache, and core offline training/backfill flows now use SQLite as the primary path; legacy JSON/JSONL files remain only for migration, export, and explicit fallback input.
- Intraday analysis is now positioned as a professional meteorology read: headline, confidence, base/upside/downside paths, next observation point, evidence chain, failure modes, and confirmation rules.
- Intraday modal now blocks stale cached detail during refresh, so users do not briefly trade off old city/date data before full detail arrives.
- Terminal chart/detail workflow now combines settlement observations, DEB hourly consensus, model context, probability distribution tooltips, and market-bucket mapping without blocking the chart on AI text generation.
- Terminal data uses page memory cache, browser `localStorage`, backend short-TTL cache, SSE patch replay, and foreground refresh so returning from another tab restores the latest visible chart state quickly.
- Market bucket matching now uses the full `all_buckets` surface and strict exact / range / or-higher / or-lower direction checks, reducing bad matches to unreasonable tail buckets.
- The market-signal difference means `model probability - market-implied probability`; positive values indicate weather probability above market pricing, while negative values indicate the YES is already priced more fully.
- Calibrated model probability is now the primary probability panel. It shows the DEB normal-distribution probability engine (`deb_normal`), with the legacy Gaussian engine retained as a fallback branch; model consensus remains a secondary reference.
- Non-Hong Kong airport cities now ingest `TAF` and parse `FM / TEMPO / BECMG / PROB30/40`.
- Temperature chart now overlays `TAF Timing` markers near the expected peak window.
- Trade cue now combines upper-air structure, `TAF`, market crowding, and `edge_percent`.
- Browser extension now uses `DEB` for multi-day forecast and stays positioned as a lightweight lead-in to the main site.
- Official nearby-network layer now covers `JMA AMeDAS` (Japan) and `HKO` (Hong Kong); the Turkish MGM source has been fully removed (Ankara/Istanbul settle on airport METAR).
- Tokyo now ingests Haneda `JMA AMeDAS` 10-minute temperature as the official enhancement layer.
- Airport METAR report curves fully removed from terminal charts; only settlement-source curves, official networks (JMA/HKO), and TAF markers remain.
- Terminal charts gained a 3-day (72h) window: observations, model-consensus median/min/max, DEB anchors; x-axis ticks every 6 hours with midnight date markers.
- DEB calibration improvements: per-temperature-stratum sigma (>=37C cov90 0.820 -> 0.893), 14-day recency-weighted city bias (regime shifts converge within 2 weeks), inference correction cap raised 3C -> 5C (July's 4-6C systematic over-prediction is no longer truncated).
- Registry now covers 51 cities: Jinan (ZSJN) and Zhengzhou (ZHCC) added, Jakarta removed; Shenzhen settles on Lau Fau Shan HKO station (`lau fau shan` maps to `shenzhen`).
- Service stability: SQLite shrank 18.9GB -> 2GB (failed-queue purge, 30-day retention for raw observations/intraday snapshots, VACUUM); `load_history` caching and event-loop-safe forecast API eliminated the stall/healthz starvation incidents.
- New-user onboarding tour in the terminal (observation anchor -> DEB -> market probability).
- Payment receiver whitelist split: contract checkout validates the new contract `0x1fD90A`, manual mode validates the direct EOA `0x351a1bca`.
- Frontend design system overhauled: unified CSS token system, eliminated `!important` abuse (134→49 in light theme), consolidated breakpoints (18→10), migrated hardcoded colors to CSS variables, added ARIA attributes and focus-visible keyboard navigation. See `docs/reviews/frontend-ui-design-review.md` for the full audit trail.

## Core Capabilities

- Aggregates observations and forecasts for 51 monitored cities.
- Uses DEB (Dynamic Error Balancing) to blend multi-model highs.
- Builds a DEB-weighted hourly consensus path for peak-window logic and chart display.
- Generates settlement-oriented calibrated probability buckets via the DEB normal-distribution engine (`deb_normal`, integer-degree probability `P(T==τ)=Φ((τ+0.5-μ)/σ)-Φ((τ-0.5-μ)/σ)`), with the legacy Gaussian calibration path retained as a fallback.
- Adds terminal chart/detail workflows that combine live observations, DEB-centered high-temperature context, market-bucket mapping, and model-market difference.
- Shows calibrated Gaussian context in chart tooltips as `mu` plus the full temperature-range probability distribution, without reintroducing probability bands into the main temperature view.
- Reuses one analysis core across web dashboard and Telegram bot.
- Adds payment audit trails, replay tooling, and incident visibility in ops.
- Adds an in-app feedback loop with chart context, user-visible feedback status, ops triage, and manual point rewards for useful reports and suggestions.
- Adds peak-window-oriented intraday analysis with meteorology headline, path buckets, evidence chain, invalidation rules, and confirmation rules.
- Adds airport-side `TAF` timing overlays and airport suppression/disruption interpretation for non-Hong Kong airport cities.
- Adds official nearby-network enhancement layers for Japan and Hong Kong without replacing airport settlement anchors.

```

### Frontend (local)

```bash
cd frontend
npm ci
npm run dev
```

## Recent Highlights

- Gaussian probability tooltip now lists the full temperature-range distribution instead of only the highest-probability bucket, while the main chart remains focused on observations and forecasts.
- User feedback is now a product loop: terminal submissions attach chart context, users can track status in-app, and ops can reward useful feedback with points.
- Airport-linked contracts use the METAR / airport primary observing site as the settlement anchor. Shenzhen now settles on Lau Fau Shan HKO (LFS); Wunderground, Taipei CWA, AMSC AWOS, and NMC/CMA sources have been removed.
- Hong Kong keeps `HKO` official readings in dashboard and history, without falling back to airport METAR lines.
- Intraday analysis now separates meteorology conclusion, evidence chain, invalidation rules, confirmation rules, calibrated probability, and market reference.
- `TAF` is used as an airport-side confirmation layer, not as the main temperature model (sole source: NOAA AviationWeather).
- Calibrated probability uses the DEB normal-distribution engine by default, with the legacy Gaussian path as fallback; model vote counts remain an explanatory consensus line, not the final probability.
- Browser extension remains a lightweight monitoring + basic-bias product, while the site holds the full analysis experience.
- Realtime terminal charts use SSE patches plus replayable event storage; full HTTP detail remains the authoritative snapshot.
- Chart observations are shown in the city's local time, not the browser timezone.

## Runtime Data (Recommended on VPS)

Use external runtime storage to avoid SQLite/git conflicts:

```env
POLYWEATHER_RUNTIME_DATA_DIR=/var/lib/polyweather
POLYWEATHER_DB_PATH=/var/lib/polyweather/polyweather.db
POLYWEATHER_STATE_STORAGE_MODE=sqlite
POLYWEATHER_EVENT_STORE=redis
POLYWEATHER_REDIS_URL=redis://polyweather_redis:6379/0
POLYWEATHER_REDIS_STREAM_MAXLEN=50000
POLYWEATHER_REDIS_REQUIRED=true
```

For local development or a strict single-process fallback, keep `POLYWEATHER_EVENT_STORE=sqlite`.

## Ops Verification

### Health / system status / metrics

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/healthz
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/system/status
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/metrics
```

### Frontend cache headers

```bash
./scripts/validate_frontend_cache.sh "https://polyweather.top"
```

### Payment auto-reconciliation logs

```bash
docker compose logs -f polyweather | egrep "payment event loop started|payment confirm loop started|payment auto-confirmed"
```

### Payment runtime

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/payments/runtime
```

### Payment chains

Production payment routes are configured by the backend. Polygon remains the default checkout-contract chain, while Ethereum mainnet USDC can be enabled as a direct-transfer route so users who pay on their wallet default network are still confirmed by `intent.chain_id`.
